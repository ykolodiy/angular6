Start with the development build

content_copy
ng build
Copy everything within the output folder (dist/ by default) to a folder on the server.
If you copy the files into a server sub-folder, append the build flag, --base-href and set the <base href> appropriately.


For example, if the index.html is on the server at /my/app/index.html, set the base href to <base href="/my/app/"> like this.

content_copy
ng build --base-href=/my/app/
You'll see that the <base href> is set properly in the generated dist/index.html.

If you copy to the server's root directory, omit this step and leave the <base href> alone.

Learn more about the role of <base href> below.

Configure the server to redirect requests for missing files to index.html. Learn more about server-side redirects below.
This is not a production deployment. It's not optimized and it won't be fast for users. It might be good enough for sharing your progress and ideas internally with managers, teammates, and other stakeholders.
